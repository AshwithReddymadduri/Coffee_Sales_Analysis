# Coffee_Sales_Analysis
### overview 
In order to conduct a comprehensive coffee sales analysis, I employed a combination of Excel and Power BI to streamline the data processing and visualization processes. The initial Excel workbook contained three separate sheets of data, which I consolidated into a single dataset using Excel's powerful functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH. This consolidation allowed for a more unified and structured dataset, making it easier to analyze and derive insights. Afterward, I utilized Power BI to further enhance the data transformation and visualization aspects of the analysis. Power BI enabled me to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards, charts, and reports, which provided a more intuitive and insightful representation of the coffee sales data. This combined approach of Excel and Power BI allowed for a more thorough and effective analysis of coffee sales, enabling informed decision-making and actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies.
